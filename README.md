# 🤖 NAO Greeting Robot – Patient Interaction Module

This repository enables the **NAO humanoid robot** to engage with patients through voice recognition and greet patients.

## 🧩 Project Purpose

This module allows the **NAO robot** to recognize returning and new patients based on their **patient ID** and engage in structured voice-based conversations. The robot greets the patient and responds according to predefined intents.
